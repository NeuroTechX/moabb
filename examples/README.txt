Examples
-----------------

These examples demonstrate how to use MOABB, and its main concepts the
``dataset``, ``paradigm`` and ``evaluation``. Those examples are using
only a small number of subjects, and a small number of sessions, to
keep the execution time short. In practice, you should use all the
subjects and sessions available in the dataset.
