""" Example of P300 classification with different epoch size.

=======================================
Changing epoch size in P300 VR dataset
=======================================

This example shows how to extract the epochs from the P300-VR dataset of a given
subject and then classify them using Riemannian Geometry framework for BCI.
We compare the scores in the VR and PC conditions, using different epoch size.

This example demonstrates the use of `get_block_repetition`, which allows
to specify the experimental blocks and repetitions for analysis.

# Initialization
# ---------------
#
# 1) Create an instance of the dataset.
# 2) Create an instance of a P300 paradigm.
#    By default filtering between 1-24 Hz
#    with epochs of length 1s.
#    In this example we will be modifying the length of the epochs, by
#    changing the `tmax` attribute of the paradigm.
# 3) Encode categorical variable (Target/NonTarget) to numerical values.
#    We will be using label encoding.
