------------------------------------

Examples focusing on running benchmarks and comparing multiple models or configurations, following MOABBâ€™s evaluation
methodology.
These scripts reflect EEG decoding best practices by evaluating algorithms under consistent conditions and
tracking performance (and even resource usage).
