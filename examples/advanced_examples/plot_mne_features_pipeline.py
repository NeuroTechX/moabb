Pipelines using the mne-features library
==============================

This example shows how to evaluate a pipeline constructed using the
mne-features library [1]_. This library provides sklearn compatible
feature extractors for M/EEG data. These features
can be used directly in your pipelines.

A list of available features can be found
in `the docs <https://mne.tools/mne-features/api.html>`_.

Be sure to install mne-features by running ``pip install mne-features``.

# Creating Pipelines using mne-features
# -------------------------------------
#
# Here, we closely follow Tutorial 3, but we create pipelines using features
# extracted using the mne-features library [1]_. We instantiate the three different
# classiciation pipelines to be considered in the analysis.
# See the mne-features docs to learn more about the available features:
# https://mne.tools/mne-features/api.html#api-documentation


#######################################################################
# Feature Details
# ---------------
# We will use the `FeatureExtractor <https://mne.tools/mne-features/generated/mne_features.feature_extraction.FeatureExtractor.html>`__
# to compute features. Here, we select two simple features:
# ``variance`` and ``ptp_amp`` (peak-to-peak amplitude).
#
# **Variance:**
# Computed per channel (``c``). It measures the spread of the signal values
# (samples in vector ``x``) around their average value (``mean(x)``).
# It involves summing the squared differences between each sample and the mean,
# then normalizing, at mne-features, it is the number of samples minus 1.
#
# **Peak-to-Peak Amplitude (ptp_amp):**
# Computed per channel (``c``). This is simply the difference between the
# maximum and minimum signal values found within that channel's data vector ``x``.
# Formula: ``ptp_amp(c) = max(x) - min(x)``


sfreq = 250.0  # sampling frequency used in the datasets below

variance = FeatureExtractor(sfreq, ["variance"])
ptp_amp = FeatureExtractor(sfreq, ["ptp_amp"])

# We can also extract several features by passing more than one feature.
both = FeatureExtractor(sfreq, ["ptp_amp", "variance"])

#######################################################################
# Pipelines with ``FeatureExtractor``
# ---------------
# The ``FeatureExtractor`` from mne-features is scikit-learn compatible and
# can therefore be used directly in our pipelines. Here, these transformer
# steps perform feature extraction, reducing the dimensionality of the data.
# We train an LDA classifier to classify our data as left- or right hand
# based on the extracted signal.
pipelines = {}
pipelines["var+LDA"] = make_pipeline(variance, LDA())
pipelines["ptp_amp+LDA"] = make_pipeline(ptp_amp, LDA())
pipelines["var+ptp_amp+LDA"] = make_pipeline(both, LDA())

##############################################################################
# The rest is the same as in previous tutorials!

datasets = [BNCI2014_001()]
subj = [1, 2, 3]
for d in datasets:
    d.subject_list = subj
paradigm = LeftRightImagery()
evaluation = WithinSessionEvaluation(
    paradigm=paradigm, datasets=datasets, overwrite=False
)
results = evaluation.process(pipelines)

##############################################################################
# Plotting Results
# ----------------
#
# The following plot shows a comparison of the three classification pipelines
# for each subject. We can see that subjects 1 and 3, the pipeline using
# only the variance performs best. Perhaps this is because the variance is
# less sensitive to noise than the peak-to-peak amplitude, as the variance
# is computed over the whole epoch, whereas the peak-to-peak amplitude
# only considers the two most extreme data points (which could be outliers).
# For subject 2, the peak-to-peak amplitude pipeline works best.
# In general, the pipeline using both peak-to-peak amplitude and variance
# has a mediocre performance, never beating the best single-feature pipeline
# in this experiment. This might be because using both
# variance and peak-to-peak amplitude increases the data dimensionality,
# without adding a lot of new information, resulting in increased overfitting.
