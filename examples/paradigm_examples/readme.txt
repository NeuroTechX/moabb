Paradigm-Specific Evaluation Examples (Within- & Cross-Session)
---------------------------------------------------------------

These examples demonstrate how to evaluate BCI algorithms on different paradigms (Motor Imagery, P300, SSVEP), covering within-session (training and testing on the same session) and
transfer scenarios like cross-session or cross-subject evaluations.
They reflect best practices in assessing model generalization across sessions and subjects in EEG research.
