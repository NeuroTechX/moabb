"""A paradigm defines how the raw data will be converted to trials ready to be
processed by a decoding algorithm.

This is a function of the paradigm used, i.e. in motor imagery one can
have two-class, multi-class, or continuous paradigms; similarly,
different preprocessing is necessary for ERP vs ERD paradigms.
