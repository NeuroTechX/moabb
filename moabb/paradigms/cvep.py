class BaseCVEP(BaseParadigm):
    """Base c-VEP paradigm for epoch-level decoding.

    Please use one of the child classes.

    This paradigm is meant to be used for epoch-level decoding of c-VEP
    datasets; this means that the goal of the classifiers with this paradigm
    is to predict, for every stimulation one by one, the amplitude of
    the target code. The code value is between 0  (i.e., stimulation off)
    and 1 (i.e., maximal stimulation).

    Parameters
    ----------

    filters: tuple of tuple (defaults ((1.0, 45.0),))
        Bank of bandpass filter to apply.

    events: List of str | None (default None)
        Event to use for epoching. Note, we stick to a convention where the
        intensity level is encoded as float. For example, a binary sequence
        would have events 1.0 (i.e., on) and 0.0 (i.e., off). If None, default
        to all events defined in the dataset.

    n_classes: int or None (default None)
        Number of classes each dataset must have. All dataset classes if None.

    tmin: float (default 0.0)
        Start time (in second) of the epoch, relative to the dataset specific
        task interval e.g. tmin = 1 would mean the epoch will start 1 second
        after the beginning of the task as defined by the dataset.

    tmax: float | None (default None)
        End time (in second) of the epoch, relative to the beginning of the
        dataset specific task interval. tmax = 5 would mean the epoch will end
        5 second after the beginning of the task as defined in the dataset. If
        None, use the dataset value.

    baseline: None | tuple of length 2 (default None)
        The time interval to consider as “baseline” when applying baseline
        correction. If None, do not apply baseline correction.
        If a tuple (a, b), the interval is between a and b (in seconds),
        including the endpoints.
        Correction is applied by computing the mean of the baseline period
        and subtracting it from the data (see mne.Epochs)

    channels: list of str | None (default None)
        list of channel to select. If None, use all EEG channels available in
        the dataset.

    resample: float | None (default None)
        If not None, resample the eeg data with the sampling rate provided.
