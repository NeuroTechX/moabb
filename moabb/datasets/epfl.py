    **Dataset Description**

    In the present work a six-choice P300 paradigm is tested using a population
    of five disabled and four able-bodied subjects. Six different images were
    flashed in random order with a stimulus interval of 400 ms. Users were
    facing a laptop screen on which six im- ages were displayed. The images
    showed a television, a telephone, a lamp, a door, a window, and a radio.

    The images were flashed in random sequences, one image at a time. Each
    flash of an image lasted for 100 ms and during the following 300 ms none of
    the images was flashed, i.e. the interstimulus interval was 400 ms. The EEG
    was recorded at 2048 Hz sampling rate from 32 electrodes placed at the
    standard positions of the 10-20 international system. The system was tested
    with five disabled and four healthy subjects. The disabled subjects were
    all wheelchair-bound but had varying communication and limb muscle control
    abilities (Subjects 1 to 5). In particular, Subject 5 was only able
    to perform extremely slow and relatively uncontrolled movements with hands
    and arms. Due to a severe hypophony and large fluctuations in the level of
    alertness, communication with subject 5 was very difficult, which is why
    its data is not available in this dataset. Subjects 6 to 9 were PhD
    students recruited from our laboratory (all male, age 30 Â± 2.3).

    Each subject completed four recording sessions. The first two sessions were
    performed on one day and the last two sessions on another day. For all
    subjects the time between the first and the last session was less than two
    weeks. Each of the sessions consisted of six runs, one run for each of the
    six images. The duration of one run was approximately one minute and the
    duration of one session including setup of electrodes and short breaks
    between runs was approximately 30 minutes. One session comprised on average
    810 trials, and the whole data for one subject consisted on average of 3240
    trials.
