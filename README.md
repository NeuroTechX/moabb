## What are we doing?

### The problem

[Brain-Computer Interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface)
allow to interact with a computer using brain signals. In this project, we focus mostly on
electroencephalographic signals
([EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography)), that is a very active
research domain, with worldwide scientific contributions. Still:

- Reproducible Research in BCI has a long way to go.
- While many BCI datasets are made freely available, researchers do not publish code, and
  reproducing results required to benchmark new algorithms turns out to be trickier than
  it should be.
- Performances can be significantly impacted by parameters of the preprocessing steps,
  toolboxes used and implementation “tricks” that are almost never reported in the
  literature.

As a result, there is no comprehensive benchmark of BCI algorithms, and newcomers are
spending a tremendous amount of time browsing literature to find out what algorithm works
best and on which dataset.

### The solution

The Mother of all BCI Benchmarks allows to:

- Build a comprehensive benchmark of popular BCI algorithms applied on an extensive list
  of freely available EEG datasets.
- The code is available on GitHub, serving as a reference point for the future algorithmic
  developments.
- Algorithms can be ranked and promoted on a website, providing a clear picture of the
  different solutions available in the field.

This project will be successful when we read in an abstract “ … the proposed method
obtained a score of 89% on the MOABB (Mother of All BCI Benchmarks), outperforming the
state of the art by 5% ...”.

## Installation

### Pip installation

To use MOABB, you could simply do: \
`pip install MOABB` \
See [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) section if you have a problem.

### Manual installation

You could fork or clone the repository and go to the downloaded directory, then run:

1. install `poetry` (only once per machine):\
   `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`\
   or [checkout installation instruction](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) or
   use [conda forge version](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/poetry)
1. (Optional, skip if not sure) Disable automatic environment creation:\
   `poetry config virtualenvs.create false`
1. install all dependencies in one command (have to be run in the project directory):\
   `poetry install`

See [contributors' guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed explanation.

### Requirements we use

See `pyproject.toml` file for full list of dependencies

## Running

### Verify Installation

To ensure it is running correctly, you can also run

```
python -m unittest moabb.tests
```

once it is installed.

### Use MOABB

First, you could take a look at our [tutorials](./tutorials) that cover the most important
concepts and use cases. Also, we have a several [examples](./examples/) available.

You might be interested in [MOABB documentation][link_moabb_docs]

### Moabb and docker

Moabb has a default image to run the benchmark. You have two options to download this
image: build from scratch or pull from the docker hub. **We recommend pulling from the
docker hub**.

If this were your first time using docker, you would need to **install the docker** and
**login** on docker hub. We recommend the
[official](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) docker documentation
for this step, it is essential to follow the instructions.

After installing docker, you can pull the image from the docker hub:

```bash
docker pull baristimunha/moabb
# rename the tag to moabb
docker tag baristimunha/moabb moabb
```

If you want to build the image from scratch, you can use the following command at the
root. You may have to login with the API key in the
[NGC Catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/) to run this command.

```bash
bash docker/create_docker.sh
```

With the image downloaded or rebuilt from scratch, you will have an image called `moabb`.
To run the default benchmark, still at the root of the project, and you can use the
following command:

```bash
mkdir dataset
mkdir results
mkdir output
bash docker/run_docker.sh PATH_TO_ROOT_FOLDER
```

An example of the command is:

```bash
cd /home/user/project/moabb
mkdir dataset
mkdir results
mkdir output
bash docker/run_docker.sh /home/user/project/moabb
```

Note: It is important to use an absolute path for the root folder to run, but you can
modify the run_docker.sh script to save in another path beyond the root of the project. By
default, the script will save the results in the project's root in the folder `results`,
the datasets in the folder `dataset` and the output in the folder `output`.

### Troubleshooting

Currently pip install moabb fails when pip version < 21, e.g. with 20.0.2 due to an `idna`
package conflict. Newer pip versions resolve this conflict automatically. To fix this you
can upgrade your pip version using: `pip install -U pip` before installing `moabb`.

## Supported datasets

The list of supported datasets can be found here :
https://neurotechx.github.io/moabb/datasets.html

Detailed information regarding datasets (electrodes, trials, sessions) are indicated on
the wiki: https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb/wiki/Datasets-Support

### Submit a new dataset

you can submit a new dataset by mentioning it to this
[issue](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb/issues/1). The datasets currently on our radar
can be seen [here](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb/wiki/Datasets-Support).

## Architecture and Main Concepts

<p align="center">
  <img alt="banner" src="/images/architecture.png/" width="400">
</p>
There are 4 main concepts in the MOABB: the datasets, the paradigm, the evaluation, and the pipelines. In addition, we offer statistical and visualization utilities to simplify the workflow.

### Datasets

A dataset handles and abstracts low-level access to the data. The dataset will read data
stored locally, in the format in which they have been downloaded, and will convert them
into a MNE raw object. There are options to pool all the different recording sessions per
subject or to evaluate them separately.

### Paradigm

A paradigm defines how the raw data will be converted to trials ready to be processed by a
decoding algorithm. This is a function of the paradigm used, i.e. in motor imagery one can
have two-class, multi-class, or continuous paradigms; similarly, different preprocessing
is necessary for ERP vs ERD paradigms.

### Evaluations

An evaluation defines how we go from trials per subject and session to a generalization
statistic (AUC score, f-score, accuracy, etc) -- it can be either within-recording-session
accuracy, across-session within-subject accuracy, across-subject accuracy, or other
transfer learning settings.

### Pipelines

Pipeline defines all steps required by an algorithm to obtain predictions. Pipelines are
typically a chain of sklearn compatible transformers and end with a sklearn compatible
estimator. See
[Pipelines](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html)
for more info.

### Statistics and visualization

Once an evaluation has been run, the raw results are returned as a DataFrame. This can be
further processed via the following commands to generate some basic visualization and
statistical comparisons:

```
from moabb.analysis import analyze

results = evaluation.process(pipeline_dict)
analyze(results)
```
