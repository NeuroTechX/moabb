## How can I contribute?

This is currently a small, humble project so our contribution process is rather casual. If there's a feature you'd be interested in building, go ahead! Let us know on the [NeuroTechX Slack](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZyzhVdOLU8_oQ4NylHL8EFoKLIVmryGXA4u7HDsZpkTryvg/viewform) or [open an issue](../../issues) so others can follow along and we'll support you as much as we can. When you're finished submit a pull request to the master branch referencing the specific issue you addressed.

If you find a bug, or have a suggestion on how to improve the project, just fill out a [Github issue](../../issues)

### Steps to Contribute
