It measures the spread of the signal values\n(samples in vector ``x``) around their average value (``mean(x)``).\nIt involves summing the squared differences between each sample and the mean,\nthen normalizing, at mne-features, it is the number of samples minus 1.\n\n**Peak-to-Peak Amplitude (ptp_amp):**\nComputed per channel (``c``). This is simply the difference between the\nmaximum and minimum signal values found within that channel's data vector ``x``.\nFormula: ``ptp_amp(c) = max(x) - min(x)``\n\n"

We can see that subjects 1 and 3, the pipeline using\nonly the variance performs best. Perhaps this is because the variance is\nless sensitive to noise than the peak-to-peak amplitude, as the variance\nis computed over the whole epoch, whereas the peak-to-peak amplitude\nonly considers the two most extreme data points (which could be outliers).\nFor subject 2, the peak-to-peak amplitude pipeline works best.\n\nIn general, the pipeline using both peak-to-peak amplitude and variance\nhas a mediocre performance, never beating the best single-feature pipeline\nin this experiment. This might be because using both\nvariance and peak-to-peak amplitude increases the data dimensionality,\nwithout adding a lot of new information, resulting in increased overfitting.\n\n"
