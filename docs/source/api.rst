   architecture

There are 4 main concepts in the MOABB: the datasets, the paradigm, the
evaluation, and the pipelines. In addition, we offer statistical and
visualization utilities to simplify the workflow.

Datasets
--------

A dataset handles and abstracts low-level access to the data. The
dataset will read data stored locally, in the format in which they have
been downloaded, and will convert them into an MNE raw object. There are
options to pool all the different recording sessions per subject or to
evaluate them separately.

.. include:: api/datasets.rst


Paradigm
--------

A paradigm defines how the raw data will be converted to trials ready to
be processed by a decoding algorithm. This is a function of the paradigm
used, i.e. in motor imagery one can have two-class, multi-class, or
continuous paradigms; similarly, different preprocessing is necessary
for ERP vs ERD paradigms.

Evaluations
-----------

An evaluation defines how we go from trials per subject and session to a
generalization statistic (AUC score, f-score, accuracy, etc) â€“ it can be
either within-recording-session accuracy, across-session within-subject
accuracy, across-subject accuracy, or other transfer learning settings.

Pipelines
---------

Pipeline defines all steps required by an algorithm to obtain
predictions. Pipelines are typically a chain of sklearn compatible
transformers and end with a sklearn compatible estimator. See
`Pipelines <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html>`__
for more info.

Statistics and visualization
----------------------------

Once an evaluation has been run, the raw results are returned as a
DataFrame. This can be further processed via the following commands to
generate some basic visualization and statistical comparisons:

.. code:: python

   from moabb.analysis import analyze

   results = evaluation.process(pipeline_dict)
   analyze(results)

.. include:: api/analysis.rst
.. include:: api/utils.rst
