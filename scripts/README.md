# Utility Scripts for MOABB

**If you only want to use MOABB for benchmarking you probably will not need to use any of
these scripts.**

## Overview

- `data_visualization_*`: Scripts starting with data_visualization download ALL datasets
  for a specific paradigm to create, e.g., descriptive statistics and plots. As datasets
  should not change over time, most of these only need to be run once and the results
  could be stored somewhere else.
